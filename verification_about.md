# What is program verification about

##Definition
Program verification is the study of mathematical methods for verifying whether or not a program executes as it is intended.[1]

##The area
Program verification is one of the branches of the broader meaning of formal methods. Formal methods form systems and software development.

Program verification utilises various methods to study the properties of the code. This can be studied by program logic, first-order theories, software model checking, abstract interpretation and symbolic execution.[1]

##The goals
The goal of program verification is to prevent unintended consequences caused by errors that can occur while executing a program. The interest of this area is not only limited to mission-critical systems but also include commercial products such as a newly developed hardware driver. Program verification is eager to achieve the ultimate prevention of loss of assets, oneâ€™s life or/and the reputation of the company caused by the software that has unknown flaws.

##Why does program verification matters?
Nowadays, computers are widely used in many areas of the industry. To utilise computers, an appropriate program designed specifically for each need is required. However, as all programs have bugs, sometimes programs outputs incorrect/unintended results or falls to runtime errors. In general environment, some inaccuracy of the result or sudden shut down of the program does not matter, but in mission-critical industries, even an instant shut down can cause disastrous results. The Smaller difference in output result from the input as well, makes an enormous amount of resources to be consumed. In order to prevent those catastrophic consequences, programs should be checked whether or not they produce correct output or whether or not runtime errors occur during the execution of the program. Therefore, program verification assures the quality of the program, which results in a frustration-free software development.
