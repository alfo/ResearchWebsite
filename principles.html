        <p class="leader">Programming Principles is a subset of the larger area of Theoretical Computer Science&#46 Programming Principles include fundamental concepts such as use of resources&#44 language design and how programmers think&#46</p>

        <p>Computer Science is still a very young field&#46 Therefore&#44 it is highly likely that our current understanding of systems&#44 programs and resources still needs refining&#46 The value of creating these new approaches to programming is that&#44 ideally&#44 they will result in safer&#44 faster and more reliable computing&#46</p>

        <h2>Why Principles Matters</h2>

        <p>The reason that programming principles such as DRY (Don&#39t Repeat Yourself) and YAGNI (You Aren&#39t Gonna Need It) exist are to aid programmers in designing their software well&#46 Important criteria for well&#45designed software include the software being testable&#44 clear and well&#45documented&#46 Poorly&#45designed software is difficult to fix&#44 if the issues can even be diagnosed at all&#46</p>

        <p>Bad software design can lead to devastating consequences&#44 as tragically seen in the 1980s&#46 The Therac&#4525 was a pioneering radiation therapy machine&#44 produced in 1982 in Canada&#44 that was supposed to treat patients with cancer&#46 However&#44 due to numerous issues in the code&#44 the machine occasionally malfunctioned and administered radiation doses hundreds of times greater than the intended dose&#46 There were at least six accidents of this nature&#44 between 1985 and 1987&#44 resulting in three deaths&#46 </p>

      <div class="container">

        <p>When the code was scrutinised&#44 researchers found that a deadly cocktail of problems caused this tragedy&#46 One issue was that code was reused from older models of the hardware&#44 and said code didn&#39t function properly in the new machine&#46 Another was that even though the system detected an error with the dosage&#44 it only displayed a simple error code which wasn&#39t even mentioned in the user manual&#46 Thus the operators&#44 who had become so accustomed to seeing &#39MALFUNCTION&#39 display on the screen for relatively trivial errors&#44 ignored the important warnings and allowed the machine to continue running&#46 Thus&#44 the importance of well&#45designed&#44 well&#45documented and well&#45tested code must never be underestimated&#46</p>

        <ol class="timeline">

          <li><span>1954</span>John Backus &#45 He developed FORTRAN at IBM&#46 It was the first general purpose programming language used in machines&#46</li>

          <li><span>1982</span>One of the first mentions of the abstraction principle&#44 in a book by A&#46 J&#46 Cole and R&#46 Morrison [2]&#46 The abstraction principle involves creating a function to use multiple times in a program instead of simply copy&#45pasting the same code throughout&#46</li>

          <li><span>1999</span>Kent Beck publishes &#39Extreme Programming Explained&#39&#44 which consolidated many important programming principles and took them to extreme levels&#46</li>

          <li><span>2001</span>&#39Manifesto for Agile Software Development&#39 is published&#46 Agile software development places emphasis on flexibility and continuous iteration&#46</li>
