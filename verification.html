        <p class="leader">Program verification is defined as &#39the study of mathematical methods for verifying whether or not a program executes as it is intended&#39&#46 This means applying mathematics to test if a program runs correctly&#46</p>

        <p>The goal of program verification is to prevent unintended consequences&#44 caused by errors in the code&#44 when running a program&#46 This is especially important in mission&#45critical systems (where the computer is essential in performing a task&#44 such as one on board a space shuttle)&#46 Ultimately&#44 good program verification prevents loss of assets&#44 reputation and sometimes lives&#46</p>

        <h2>Why Verification Matters</h2>

        <p>Nowadays&#44 cockpits do not have many mechanical controls for piloting the aircraft&#46 Instead&#44 they have computers embedded in the aircraft and these computers control all the engine operations&#44 hydraulic operations&#44 etc&#46 to make the aircraft fly&#46 In this case&#44 if an error occurs at runtime within the program installed on an aircraft computer&#44 it can suddenly switch off all the engines and will not process any commands that pilots make to control flaps&#44 rudders&#44 or elevators as well as the engines&#46 Such a failure could cost the lives of hundreds of passengers&#46</p>

        <p>Additionally&#44 even if a visible runtime error didn&#39t occur&#44 a calculation error could have catastrophic impacts&#46 For instance&#44 if the flight management computer fails to show the accurate flight path&#44 then the aircraft could fly through restricted zones&#44 putting the aircraft at risk of triggering military defences&#46 Good program verification reduces the chances of such events occurring&#46</p>

        <p>For the space industry&#44 it is also important to ensure that the software runs as intended since the cost of launching a spacecraft is tremendous&#46</p>

      <div class="container">

        <p>This video shows an infamous example of an unverified program causing an accident&#44 namely the launch of the "Ariane 5" rocket&#46 This explosion was caused by the imprecision when converting between two different data types&#44 floating point values (such as 1. 234) and integers&#46 This imprecision caused an exception&#44 meaning that the program could not run as expected&#46 Thus the rocket control system failed&#44 and the rocket itself exploded&#46</p>

        <h2>History</h2>

        <ol class="timeline">

          <li><span>1947</span><img src="img/verification_9&#46jpeg">John Von Neumann &#45 He suggested that for ensuring the correctness of the program&#44 writing assertions in a flow diagram is crucial&#46</li>

          <li><span>1949</span><img src="img/verification_10&#46jpeg">Alan Turing &#45 He summarised a very important mathematical thought that is required for program verification in his paper &#39Checking a Large Routine&#39&#46 <img:verification_12></li>

          <li><span>1953</span> Henry Rice &#45 He suggested that no mechanical device can verify the correctness of a program&#46</li>

          <li><span>1955</span> John McCarthy &#45 He realised the importance of mathematical logic in program verification and drew attention to the field of program verification&#46</li>

          <li><span>1955</span><img src="img/verification_11&#46jpeg">Alfred Talski &#45 His research resulted in a theorem called the &#39Fixed point theorem&#39&#44 which is key to the field&#46</li>

          <li><span>1967</span><img src="img/verification_13&#46jpeg">Robert Floyd &#45 Inspired by John McCarthy&#44 he summarised how program verification can be done&#46 His paper&#44 &#39Assigning Meaning to Programs&#39&#44 <img:verification_14>&#44 is cited today as the origin of program verification&#46</li>

          <li><span>1977</span> Edmund Clarke <img: verification_15> &#45Showed that the process of program reasoning could be viewed as a calculation in his paper &#39Program Invariants As Fixed Points&#39<img:verification_16>&#46</li>

          <li><span>2009</span> Joseph Sifakis et al&#46 &#45 They suggested a way to overcome the limitations of program verification&#44 as outlined by Rice&#39s Theorem&#46</li>
