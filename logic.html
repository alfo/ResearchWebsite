        <p class="leader">Logic is defined as &#39the principles underlying the units in a computer system that perform arithmetical and logical operations&#39&#46 This means that&#44 when coding&#44 a program needs to adhere to the rules of logic in order to function properly&#44 if at all&#46</p>

        <p>The reason people develop computer programs at all is to solve a problem&#46 Such problems&#44 in order to be expressed in code&#44 must be organised into a series of steps&#46 Logic is a proven way to check if the series of steps makes sense&#44 thus resulting in a functioning program&#46</p>

        <h2>Why Logic Matters</h2>

        <p>Logic is an important component in security&#46 In the past&#44 security was entirely physical&#46 For example&#44 someone would have their life savings in the form of physical cash&#44 which could be secured by a physical safe with a lock&#46 Nowadays&#44 it is entirely possible that one has their life savings stored in a bank&#44 and it can be accessed digitally&#46 Thus&#44 it is of the utmost importance that there are measures in place to prevent someone logging into another person&#39s account and stealing all their cash&#46</p>

        <p>Logical Security is the set of software safeguards that prevents this happening&#46 These safeguards include having usernames&#44 passwords and biometric authentication (such as fingerprint scanners on smartphones)&#46 Today&#44 HSBC gives customers a physical device to generate a one-time password that must be used (in most cases) in order to access the user&#39s bank account&#46</p>

        <p>This password&#44 in conjunction with the account password and the device&#39s own password&#44 creates an extra barrier that a thief would need to overcome in order to maliciously access money&#46 However&#44 if the logic in the device&#39s programming is incorrect&#44 the device could fail to generate secure passwords&#46 If this occurred&#44 it would be drastically simpler for someone to log in and make unauthorised transactions&#46 Therefore&#44 following the principles of logic properly is crucial in the modern world&#46</p>

        <ol class="timeline">

          <li><span>1847</span>George Boole - He first defined Boolean Algebra in &#39The Mathematical Analysis of Logic&#39</li>

          <li><span>1870s</span>Georg Cantor - He published the start of his works first proposing set theory&#44 which states that all mathematical objects can be organised into &#39sets&#39</li>

          <li><span>1908</span>Ernst Zermelo - He improved Cantor&#39s set theory&#44 fixing the flaws in the original</li>

          <li><span>1938</span>Stephen Kleene - He created a pair of recursion theorems&#44 allowing users to make functions involving recursion&#46</li>

          <li><span>1950s</span>Alfred Tarski - Along with his students at U&#46C&#46 Berkeley&#44 he developed model theory&#46 Model theory links mathematical logic to structures such as graphs&#46</li>
