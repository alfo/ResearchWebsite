#Introduction

 Computers are ubiquitous. Underpinning every computer-performed task is PPLV. From the seemingly omni-present smartphone, to military drones that attack locations thousands of miles from the pilot, PPLV ensures everything goes as planned.

Without following good programming principles, the drone would be difficult to adjust to new environments. Without sound logic, the drone wouldn't respond to instructions properly. Without good verification, bugs could cause the drone to misfire. Any of these scenarios could be the difference between life and death.
