# History of program verification
## Timeline from [2]
1947 - John Von Neumann <img: verification_9> -He suggested that for ensuring the correctness of the program, writing assertions in a flow diagram is crucial.

1949 - Alan Turing <img: verification_10> - He summarised a very important mathematical thought that is required for program verification in his paper 'Checking a Large Routine'. <img:verification_12>

1953 - Henry Rice - He suggested that no mechanical device can verify the correctness of a program.

1955 - John McCarthy - He realised the importance of mathematical logic in program verification and drew attention to the field of program verification.

1955 - Alfred Talski <img: verification_11> - His research resulted in a theorem called the 'Fixed point theorem', which is key to the field.

1967 - Robert Floyd <img: verification_13> - Inspired by John McCarthy, he summarised how program verification can be done. His paper, 'Assigning Meaning to Programs', <img:verification_14>, is cited today as the origin of program verification.

1977 - Edmund Clarke <img: verification_15> -Showed that the process of program reasoning could be viewed as a calculation in his paper 'Program Invariants As Fixed Points'<img:verification_16>.
 
2009 - Joseph Sifakis et al. - They suggested a way to overcome the limitations of program verification, as outlined by Rice's Theorem.
