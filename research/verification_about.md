# What is program verification about.

## Definition
Program verification is the study of mathematical methods for verifying whether or not a program executes as it is intended.[1]

## The area
Program verification is one of the branches of the broader area of formal methods. Formal methods create systems and software development.

Program verification utilises various methods to study the properties of the code.[1]

## The goals
The goal of program verification is to prevent unintended consequences, caused by errors, that can occur while executing a program. Program verification is not only important in mission-critical systems but even in commercial products such as a newly developed hardware driver. The goal of having good program verification is to prevent loss of assets, reputation or even life.

## Why does program verification matter?
Nowadays, computers are widely used in all areas of life. Each task a computer performs is the result of a program. However, due to bugs, a program can cause a computer to malfunction with a range of consequences. In many cases, a crash or erroneous result is little more than annoying, but in mission-critical industries, any crash can cause disastrous results. Small errors in calculation results can cause far more resource usage than expected. In order to prevent those catastrophic consequences, programs should be checked to see if they produce the correct output, or if there are errors during runtime. Therefore, program verification assures the quality of the program, which results in smooth running of the program.
Additionally, program verification provides an opportunity for engineers to better understand the program in terms of resources that the program requires or the security features. This benefits the software development, which results in better programs.
